    # Jump to label and come back
    jalr x2, x1, 0        # Jump to the address in x1, return address saved in x2
    addi x5, x5, 1        # Increment x5 to mark that we returned here, x5 = 2

    # Termination (using the magic instruction)
    slti x0, x0, -256     # Magic instruction to end the simulation

    # Target label for jump, must align with the address placed in x1
